The goal of this script is to copy your installed freebsd system into a zfs file system. Everything will be on zfs (even your /), except the /boot.

To use this script, you need an USB stick (or any bootable device), and a zpool (can be mirror, raidz1, raidz2, anything).

The script will copy your / into "<your_pool>/system/root" and any other partition mounted directly into / (like usr, var or tmp), into "<your_pool>/system/<partition>". And it will format your USB stick (using gpt), make it bootable and copy your /boot into it.

At the end you can shutdown your system, remove your original disk, and boot with your USB stick and your zpool.

Of course make a backup of all your data, before using this script. This script should not touch your original freebsd system (except if there are bugs... and there are always bugs...).


tested on FreeBSD 8.2
